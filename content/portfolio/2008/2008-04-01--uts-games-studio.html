The UTS Games Studio is a small group of students and researchers whose interests include graphics programming, virtual reality, animation, interaction design, and game development. The studio is affiliated with the UTS <a href="http://www.creativityandcognition.com/">Creativity and Cognition Studios</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.feit.uts.edu.au/">Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology</a>. While doing my Honours year in IT during 2008, I was a member of the Games Studio.

I built a relatively simple Drupal site for the Games Studio, using a third-party theme with some small modifications, and using very few add-on modules. Most of the site consists of static pages managed hierarchically with the book module. The news archive and the profile directory are structured sections built with CCK and Views.
