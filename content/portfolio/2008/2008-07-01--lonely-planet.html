Lonely Planet is the world's leading publisher of travel guides and phrasebooks. I spent most of 2008 working for Lonely Planet remotely in a freelance capacity, while the company was undertaking a massive redesign and redevelopment of its entire web presence. I was part of the "LP labs" group, which was responsible for the more experimental of the new features that were going into the revamped web presence at the time.

I spent most of my time with Lonely Planet working on the <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/press-centre/press-release.cfm?press_release_id=373">iPhone phrasebook app</a> that was launched in late 2008. I developed a set of scripts to import thousands of phrases (in about 10 languages) from CSV files into a database, to perform complex queries on the phrases, and to expose the phrase querying as a web service for use by the iPhone app dev team.

I also developed a prototype <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Jaza/reputation-api-presentation-slides-presentation">Reputation API</a>, a generic system designed to calculate and to monitor the reputation of users on a typical community site. the prototype was developed as a Drupal module, with a view to ultimately being deployed on Lonely Planet's new Drupal-powered main site.
