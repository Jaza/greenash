Pygmy Possum Lodge is a place to stay in beautiful Charlotte Pass, Australia's highest populated place. The lodge is owned and managed by Elouera Ski Club. As a long-time friend of several members of the club, and as a long-time guest at the lodge, I decided to build a prototype of a new web site and booking engine for the Pygmy Possum. The app is built with Flask. This was something that I did completely voluntarily and in my own spare time.

The prototype sports a more modern, accessible, responsive look than its predecessor site. The booking engine provides a friendlier UI for applying to stay at the lodge, and it also includes considerable admin functionality, to cater for the extensive custom rules in place for bookings at the Pygmy Possum.
