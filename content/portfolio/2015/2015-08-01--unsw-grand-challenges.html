UNSW Grand Challenges is a project that was launched by the <a href="http://sustainability.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW Sustainability</a> Office. Its centrepiece is an initiative called the "Grand Climate Challenge". The Office commissioned a site to promote the project. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://vector5.com.au/">Vector 5</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site is a fairly basic one-page Drupal affair. It allows upcoming events to be listed, it allows embedding of videos from YouTube, and it has a mailing list subscription form.
