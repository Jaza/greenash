The Daydream Believers Performers is a singing group in Sydney's east, for children with special needs, their families, and other caring souls. The group desired a web presence to promote their activities online. I volunteered to build a site for this purpose. The site is built in Flask, and is hosted by GreenAsh free of charge.

The site is contained in a single page, and it includes a photo gallery, an events listing, and a contact form. All content on the site is editable by administrators. The CMS-like app that I built for this project, I later cleaned up and released as the open-source <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/flask-editablesite">Flask Editable Site</a> project.
