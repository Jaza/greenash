eLearner (originally called "Interactive Learning") is an online learning app that allows students to complete quizzes containing multiple-choice questions. This app was built for the <a href="https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/mechanical-engineering/">UNSW School of Mechanical Engineering</a>, and was used for reinforcement learning in the school's undergraduate courses. The app is built with Flask. In my capacity as a full-time employee at <a href="http://vector5.com.au/">Vector 5</a>, I was the lead developer on this project. This was done in collaboration with <a href="http://www.thefarmdigital.com/">The Farm Digital</a>, who were responsible for the front-end design; and with <a href="http://www.refractionmedia.com.au/">Refraction Media</a>, who were responsible for the content and structure of the pilot quizzes.

eLearner was the second app to be built on Vector 5's <a href="https://platform.lasr.io/">LASR platform</a>. Due to the clients' specific design and branding requirements, it was the first LASR app to allow different themes to be applied to different site instances, which has since become a key feature of the platform. It was also the first LASR app to offer detailed graphical reports of student metrics within a site instance (using the <a href="http://nvd3.org/">NVD3</a> charting library).
