Qualtrics (originally called Qualmetrics) is an online learning app, that allows students to complete a set of surveys on <a href="http://www.qualtrics.com/">qualtrics.com</a>, and to see a graphical overview of their completed survey activity progress within a course. This app was built for the <a href="https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/ltu">UNSW Learning and Teaching Unit</a>, and was used in a pilot course by the <a href="http://cofa.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW COFA</a> faculty. The app is built with Flask. In my capacity as a full-time employee at <a href="http://vector5.com.au/">Vector 5</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

Qualtrics was the third app built on Vector 5's <a href="https://platform.lasr.io/">LASR platform</a>. Like other LASR apps, it uses <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability">LTI</a> for single sign-on from Coursera, Moodle, and other LMSes. Qualtrics extended LASR's LTI capability to include grade writeback per activity. It also heavily integrates with qualtrics.com: surveys can be imported via the Qualtrics API, and survey responses and grades are retrieved via the Qualtrics API in order to determine a student's activity progress.
