The LASR (Learning Application Syndication & Reporting) Platform (originally called SynPla, for "Syndication Platform") is an app that allows for the creation of online learning site instances. This app was built for the <a href="https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/ltu">UNSW Learning and Teaching Unit</a>. The app is built with Flask. In my capacity as a full-time employee at <a href="http://vector5.com.au/">Vector 5</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

LASR itself is responsible for managing users and instances. Other apps that build upon LASR (such as <a href="https://eportoflio.lasr.io/">eJournal</a>, <a href="https://elearner.lasr.io/">eLearner</a>, and <a href="https://qualtrics.lasr.io/">Qualtrics</a>) are responsible for actual online learning functionality. The LASR Platform provides an API for these apps to leverage. LASR is designed as a SaaS (Software as a Service) app: multiple organisations (i.e. universities or similar) can be defined in the back-end, and each of these organisations then has an admin instance which exists on its own subdomain, and which can have its own styling and branding.
