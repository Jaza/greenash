Flask Editable Site is "a template for building a small marketing web site in Flask where all content is live editable". Its aim is to demonstrate that, with the help of modern JS libraries, and with some well-thought-out server-side snippets, it's now perfectly possible to "bake in" live in-place editing for virtually every content element in a typical brochureware site.

The code for this project started out in prototype form, when I built the <a href="http://daydreambelievers.greenash.net.au/">Daydream Believers</a> web site. I then cleaned up the code, and released it as an open-source project on GitHub. A <a href="https://flask-editablesite.herokuapp.com/">demo of Flask Editable Site is deployed on Heroku</a>.
