Laser Clinics Australia is one of the country's biggest providers of hair removal and skin treatment services. They required a number of custom reports to be built for their sales and appointment data. For this reason, the LCA Reports app was commissioned. The app is built with Flask. In my capacity as a full-time employee at <a href="http://vector5.com.au/">Vector 5</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The app periodically imports its source data from a series of CSV files, which are provided regularly by <a href="http://www.booker.com/">booker.com</a>, the service that handles LCA's sales and appointments. The app essentially consists of, for each report, a custom SQL query, and an interface for filtering / sorting the tabular results.
