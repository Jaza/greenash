One of the company's flagship products, Xplan is "complete and comprehensive financial planning and wealth management software for advice practices of any size". As a full-time of employee of Iress, I spent 2016-2020 on the dev team for Xplan Portfolio, which is described as "financial software for end-to-end support of any investment management portfolio".

I was one of the full-stack devs &ndash; and, in my final few years, the lead back-end dev &ndash; for Xplan Portfolio, which is built primarily as a Python web app. I worked on many features, particularly those built for the new "Sparkle" UI, designed to better cater for those Iress clients that are most engaged in PWM (Private Wealth Management).
