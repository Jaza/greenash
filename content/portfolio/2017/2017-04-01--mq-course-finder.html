Macquarie University is one of Sydney's premier tertiary education institutions. Working freelance as part of the <a href="http://newground.io/">New Ground</a> team, I helped to build the University's new Course Finder site. I was one of the lead API developers working on the app's Laravel PHP back-end. The front-end site (slash mobile app) was built using React.

The app allows data from the existing MQ handbook database to be imported, for every new year of course offerings. It exposes course and related info via a collection of RESTful APIs.
