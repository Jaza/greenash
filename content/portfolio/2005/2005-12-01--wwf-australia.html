The World Wide Fund for Nature Australia (WWF-Australia) hired GreenAsh to help in developing a custom administrative interface for their home-grown <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>. The interface allows staff to easily add and update pages and media assets on the site. WWF-Australia plans to release their CMS solution as an open-source product called <em>Yak</em> at some point in the future.

GreenAsh was also (initially) hired to develop a pilot Drupal site, to assess the suitability of Drupal as a potential replacement for WWF's home-grown CMS. However, WWF ultimately decided to stick with their own solution.
