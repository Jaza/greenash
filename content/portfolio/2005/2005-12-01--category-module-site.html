I decided to make the category module web site, as a support and documentation source for the Drupal <a href="http://drupal.org/project/category">category module</a> that I wrote. I designed and implemented the distinctive theme of the site, and developed what was probably the first ever Drupal site to be <a href="/posts/news/category-module-site-released">powered by the category module</a>. I also implemented Drupal's multi-site functionality, to allow sharing of some entities (such as users) between the main site and the <a href="demosite/">category module demo</a> sub-site.

I have been (and continue to be) the main content contributor for this site, although the site is open to contributions from anyone. I also, naturally, take care of the site's support and maintenance.
