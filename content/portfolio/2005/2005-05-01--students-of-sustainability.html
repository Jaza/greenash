The wonderful organisers of Students of Sustainability asked me to help out with the web site for their 2005 conference. I converted their site design materials into a standards-compliant template, and I developed a complete site solution for them, using a set of custom PHP scripts. The custom PHP scripts allowed for things such as a contact form, and a multi-step conference registration form.

The site is now maintained by a new set of volunteers, who have decided to continue using my template and custom script for the 2006 conference.
