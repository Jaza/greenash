The UNSW Annual Report is a publication containing the highlights, statistics, and achievements of the University over the previous calendar year. Up until now, the report had been published only in printed and in PDF format. This year, for the first time, a web site was also commissioned as a new format for the report. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site consists almost exclusively of static content; however, this doesn't mean that its development was without technical challenges. There are a large number of custom content blocks throughout the site, containing a mix of text, statistics, image rollovers, and graphs. The styling and management of these blocks was a hefty task. The demands of the stakeholders meant that careful attention to detail was required in implementing this site's design.
