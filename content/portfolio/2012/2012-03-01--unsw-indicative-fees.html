UNSW Indicative Fees is a new site that provides estimates of the full cost of completing a degree, for international students of the University. The site is built with Django. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site contains a large data set of degrees and costs, which was collated into a CSV file, and imported into Django via a script. Additional calculations are performed within the app, for performing fee forecasts based on the available data. The site also makes significant use of jQuery / AJAX / JSON, for its dynamic "cascading select" browsing interfaces.
