The UNSW Institute of Environmental Studies is an interdisciplinary centre affiliated with the University's Faculty of Science. The Institute commissioned a new web site to replace their ageing web presence. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site is a fairly standard UNSW Drupal affair: it has a news / events section; a large front-page carousel block; and a staff / researcher profile listing in the 'our people' section.
