In-flu-ence is the professional site of Mike Jenner, a leadership consultant and motivational speaker. Mike provides services that help corporate executives and other high-profile leaders to realise their full potential. Mike contacted me requiring assistance in making some navigational, styling, and content changes to his site, which is built as a series of static HTML pages.

I performed maintenance on this brochureware site, which had not seen a designer's or developer's touch for some time. This was basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript modification work.
