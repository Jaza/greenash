The UNSW Centre for Primary Health Care and Equity is a research centre that aims to address health inequalities and to improve community health care, with a focus on several locations in the Sydney area. The Centre commissioned a new web site to replace their ageing web presence. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site is a fairly standard UNSW Drupal affair: it has a news / events section; a projects listing; and a publications archive.
