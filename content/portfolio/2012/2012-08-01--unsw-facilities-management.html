UNSW Facilities Management (FM) is the unit responsible for managing the University's physical campus facilities: this includes campus security, infrastructure development, and building maintenance. FM commissioned a new web site to replace their ageing web presence. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site is a fairly standard UNSW Drupal affair: it has a news / events section; a large front-page carousel block; and a custom 'project' listing in the 'campus development' section.
