A fun little site that I built, in order to tell people how long we've already been waiting for the Pacific Highway in Australia to get upgraded, and how much longer we'll probably still have to wait.

A pretty simple one-page static site, which I didn't even have to build a theme for, as I used a third-party free Hugo theme. It was really just Hugo configuration, and content authoring, on my part.
