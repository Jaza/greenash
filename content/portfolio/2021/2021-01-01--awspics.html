AWSPics is "an AWS CloudFormation stack to run a serverless password-protected photo gallery", built and open-sourced by <a href="https://www.jpsim.com/">JP Simard</a>. I made some significant contributions to the AWSPics codebase, in order to get it ready for powering my own personal private photo gallery site.

The main feature that I added to AWSPics, was the ability to organise photos into a two-level hierarchy of "collections" and albums, instead of just a one-level hierarchy of albums. I also contributed some smaller bug fixes.
