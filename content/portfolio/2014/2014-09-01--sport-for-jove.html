Sport For Jove is an independent theatre company based in Sydney. For several years, their main web presence has been a Drupal site where they promote their performances and festivals. The company contracted my services as a freelancer, to take over the maintenance of the site, and also to make a number of tweaks and improvements.

The biggest change that I made to the site, was to add responsive styling, allowing it to be easily viewed on mobile and tablet devices.
