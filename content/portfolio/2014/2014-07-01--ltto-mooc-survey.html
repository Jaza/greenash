Learning to Teach Online is an innovative MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) that launched in 2014, delivered on the Coursera platform by a group of academics from UNSW. As well as the main content on Coursera, the LTTO co-ordinators commissioned the development of a prototype custom survey as a separate site, for the MOOC's students to reflect on their experience and to receive suggestions for further learning. The survey site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time employee at <a href="http://vector5.com.au/">Vector 5</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The survey site consists primarily of a series of forms, powered by the Drupal Webform module. The special feedback / suggestions pages were built as custom Drupal modules. The site's main technical feature, is its integration with Coursera using the <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/toolsinteroperability2.cfm">LTI</a> protocol, whereby students can click a link in Coursera, and be seamlessly logged in to the survey site as a third-party learning app.
