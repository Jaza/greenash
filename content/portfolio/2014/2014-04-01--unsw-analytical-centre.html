The Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre (MWAC) provide instrumentation and analysis to assist in a range of scientific research activities at UNSW. The Centre commissioned a new web site to replace its ageing web presence. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://vector5.com.au/">Vector 5</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The main structural feature of the site, is that it's broken down into sections for each of the Centre's Units and Facilities (each of these sections was formerly a separate web site). The MWAC site serves as a comprehensive database of the Centre's instruments and of its expert staff. As such, the search pages for these sets of content are of primary importance. The site also integrates with MWAC's legacy online facility booking systems.
