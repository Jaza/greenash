The National Heart Foundation of Australia is a not-for-profit that aims to reduce cardiovascular disease nation-wide. For some time, the Foundation has run a national network of local walking groups; however, the management and promotion of these groups has been largely offline or via disparate and poorly-managed online services. The Foundation contracted <a href="http://bluepenciladvertising.com.au/">Blue Pencil</a> to design a web site to serve as a hub for all local walking groups. The expertise of <a href="http://vector5.com.au/">Vector 5</a> was then sought for developing this site. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at Vector 5, I was the lead developer on this project.

The HF Walking site is built primarily in the Symfony2 PHP framework. This powers the user management, the "find a walking group" tool, and the numerous actions that users can take as members of a group. The home page and other informational pages, however, are powered by WordPress. As such, the site has quite extensive custom integration between WordPress and Symfony2 in place.
