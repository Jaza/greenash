Vector 5 is a small start-up based in Surry Hills, Sydney. I was part of the company's team from its birth at the start of 2014, first as a freelancer, and then as a full-time employee. Vector 5 specialises in custom analytics, reporting, and intelligent data solutions for a variety of clients. It's also closely affiliated with <a href="http://www.thefarmdigital.com/">The Farm Digital</a>, a Sydney-based digital design and branding agency.

One of my first projects as part of Vector 5, was to build the company's inaugural web site. The site is a simple single-page brochureware affair, powered by a light database-free PHP back-end. The most distinctive front-end feature of the site, is its use of <a href="http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/">fullPage.js</a> for funky, responsive, vertical and horizontal scrolling.
