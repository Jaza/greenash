UNSW COFA (College Of Fine Arts) is one of Australia's leading centres of visual creative learning and expression. The College commissioned a new web site to replace its ageing web presence. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://vector5.com.au/">Vector 5</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site is fairly typical in structure for a university faculty: information for new and current students, information about the college, and a showcase of student work. The most notable aspect of this site is its distinctive design (as it should be for a creative college), featuring numerous carefully-selected background images. This was also one of the first fully responsive sites that I built: it was designed from the ground up to be optimised for mobile and tablet display.
