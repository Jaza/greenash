UNSW Law is one of the University's main faculties, and is among Australia's premier centres for legal education. For some years, the faculty's main web site and several sub-sites have been powered by Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at UNSW, I was seconded to UNSW Law for about one month in order to upgrade and maintain their Drupal sites.
