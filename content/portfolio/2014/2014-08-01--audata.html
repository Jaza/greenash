AuData (Audience Data) is a custom reporting tool built for Brand New Media, a video and TV advertising company based in Sydney. The app is built with Flask (and MongoDB). In my capacity as a full-time employee at <a href="http://vector5.com.au/">Vector 5</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The main technical feature of AuData, is a custom script (running as a cron job) that imports large amounts of metrics from a variety of third-party APIs: Brightcove, Google Analytics, and YouTube. On the front-end, this metric data is visualised in a variety of graphs, which are rendered using NVD3.
