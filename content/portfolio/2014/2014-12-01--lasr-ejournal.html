eJournal (originally called ePortfolio) is an online learning app, that allows students to make long-form text submissions, which then can be curated and peer-reviewed by other students in the course. This app was built for the <a href="https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/ltu">UNSW Learning and Teaching Unit</a>, and was intended to be used in a pilot course by the <a href="http://www.be.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW Built Environment</a> faculty. The app is built with Flask. In my capacity as a full-time employee at <a href="http://vector5.com.au/">Vector 5</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

eJournal was the first of several apps to be built on Vector 5's <a href="https://platform.lasr.io/">LASR platform</a>. It was the first LASR app to implement student login via <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability">LTI</a> (allowing single sign-on from Coursera, Moodle, and other LMSes), which has since become a key feature of the platform. It also pioneered the use of <a href="https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor">MediumEditor</a> for rich-text editing within the platform.
