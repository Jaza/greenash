GOPC&trade; hired GreenAsh to assist in getting the members-only component of their site up and running. We implemented the design of their public site as a Drupal theme, and tweaked it to be cross-browser compatible and standards-compliant. We also helped them out in configuring a number of Drupal modules, including the book module and the blog module.
