As one of the cast members of the AUJS Revue for 2006, I volunteered to design and develop a web site to advertise the show. I developed a lightweight version of Drupal, called <a href="/posts/thoughts/drupal-lite-drupal-minus-its-parts">Drupal Lite</a>, especially to meet the needs of this site.

I designed and developed a theme for the site, to match the tone and the subject matter of the production. I also acted as the day-to-day maintainer of the site, performing editorial and graphic updates as needed.
