Kookaburra hired GreenAsh to develop a complete Drupal-based solution for their new web site. They wanted to make use of user interaction facilities such as forums and blogs, and they also wanted to manage their entire supporter database through Drupal's <a href="http://civicrm.org/">CiviCRM</a> module.
