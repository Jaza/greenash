Swap It Baby is a site where parents can swap their baby-related merchandise with other parents, rather than buying and selling it all. I built this site while working at <a href="http://digitaleskimo.net/">Digital Eskimo</a>. This was the first e-commerce site I built, and its e-commerce functionality is powered by <a href="http://www.ubercart.org/">Ubercart</a>. The site's main back-end feature is a custom "site credits" system, whereby users can purchase site credits via PayPal, and they can then spend their credits by purchasing items from other users, or they can earn more credits by selling items to other users.
