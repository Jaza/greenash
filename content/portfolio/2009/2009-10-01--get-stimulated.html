Get Stimulated is a tool that lets you find out, for a given electorate, how much money from the Australian government's 2009 stimulus package was spent in that area. The site uses a dataset that was released to the public for unrestricted use in 2009, and that details (among many other things) exactly where and how the AU$6.2 billion stimulus money was spent.

The site was built using Django, and it was the first Django site (of many!) that I was involved in building. I coded most of the front-end templates, and I worked on the Google Maps rendering JavaScript. Myself and the rest of the Get Stimulated team were sponsored (with days in lieu) by <a href="http://digitaleskimo.net/">Digital Eskimo</a>, of which we were all employees. The site was built and launched in one weekend, as part of <a href="http://mashupaustralia.org/">Mashup Australia</a>, an event affiliated with <a href="http://gov2.net.au/">Government 2.0</a> and hosted and sponsored by <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.
