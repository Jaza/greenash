Telstra BigPond is Australia's largest Internet Service Provider. While working at <a href="http://digitaleskimo.net/">Digital Eskimo</a>, in 2009 BigPond contracted us as their preferred web design agency. I coded HTML / CSS / JavaScript for various new and upgraded sections of the BigPond web site. In particular, I built the template for the new <a href="http://bigpond.com/unmetered/">BigPond Unmetered</a> promotional section of the site, and I worked extensively on the template for the <a href="http://bigpond.com/internet/plans/">Internet Plans</a> section. My templating work was then handed over to BigPond, who integrated it into their enterprise CMS.
