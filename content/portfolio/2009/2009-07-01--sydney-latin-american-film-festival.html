The Sydney Latin American Film Festival is a non-profit annual event that showcases film talent from the Latin world. Most of the films are independently produced, and many of them see their premiere screening here in Sydney, at the festival. Myself (developer), <a href="http://chrisgaul.net/">Chris Gaul</a> (designer) and <a href="http://darkwork.net/">Bo Daley</a> (developer) volunteered to build a new site for the 2009 festival.

The site is built on Drupal, and it's a significant improvement on the Festival's previous site, which used TextPattern. The Festival organisers made use of Drupal's strong media functionality, to show a video trailer and to present images for every film being showcased. The site ended up being a successful component of what was overall a successful (and fun!) event for 2009. It was also designed to serve as the foundation for the event's site in future years.
