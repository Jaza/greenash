I created this site as an online album for my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barmitzvah">Barmitzvah</a>, which I celebrated when I was just 13 years of age. The site <em>proudly proclaims</em> that it was created with <a href="http://www.whatdoiknow.org/archives/000461.shtml">the evil Microsoft FrontPage</a>, and that it is viewed best with <em>Internet Explorer 4</em> &mdash; but hey, this was 1999; and hey, I was 13 years old; and hey, you've gotta start somewhere, right?

Apart from the [incredibly crude] first version of <a href="http://jazasworld.greenash.net.au/">Jaza's World</a>, this was my first real attempt at designing and creating a web site; and all things considered, I think I did a reasonable job of it. The site has a number of photo galleries, as well as several pages of static text. The design is tag-soup, but it looks pretty good, and (somehow) it still renders quite well on <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">modern browsers</a>. The site was also recently migrated over to GreenAsh, and it's former home at <a href="http://www.150m.com/">Free Web Space Inc</a> has been closed down.
