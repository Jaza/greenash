A tiny site that I built, in the modest hope of making a tiny difference to the outcome of the 2022 Australian federal election in my home electorate of Bradfield.

A pretty simple one-page static site, for which I built a bare-bones responsive Hugo theme. Other than the basic design work, it was just Hugo configuration, and content authoring, on my part.
