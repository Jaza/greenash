SIMA (Spanish in Mendoza Argentina) is the tutoring business of Ana Maria Troncoso. Ana teaches Spanish to tourists and other foreigners, in private classes in her house in Mendoza, Argentina. While I was living in Mendoza, I built a new web site for Ana's business, in exchange for some Spanish lessons. I built her new site in Django, and I was responsible for all aspects of the site's design, development and deployment.

The site is a fairly basic small-business affair. Almost all of the static text and images on the site &mdash; including a number of image slideshows &mdash; can be content-managed via the Django admin. The site also features a 'testimonials' section. Additionally, the site has a Flash music player embedded in its sidebar, for (optional, opt-in) background music.
