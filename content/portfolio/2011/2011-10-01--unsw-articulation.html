UNSW Articulation is a new site that provides information about recognition of subjects / degrees from external institutions at the University. The site helps international students to determine what credit they can attain in advance, based on their academic record from an institution abroad. The site is built with Django. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site contains a large and complex data set, which was provided by faculty admins in CSV format. As such, one of my key tasks for this project was collating this CSV data, and writing a script to import it into Django. The site also makes significant use of jQuery / AJAX / JSON, for its dynamic "cascading select" browsing interfaces.
