The POWCS (Prince of Wales Clinical School) is the organisation that arranges for students within the UNSW Faculty of Medicine to undertake clinical periods, at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick. Administratively, the School is a part of the Faculty of Medicine. The administration decided to rebuild their web site from the ground up.. The new site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site is built within a multi-site framework developed by the Faculty of Medicine's technical staff. This framework allows the site to share data and features used by other Med sites, such as <a href="http://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/">NDARC</a>. One of these shared features, is the ability to display and manage data imported from the <a href="http://research.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW Research Gateway</a>. The site makes heavy use of custom per-section theming. It also sports some large and multi-faceted navigation menus, several of which are built with the aid of jQuery.
