The UNSW Corporate site is the University's online front page, the first stop for many students, researchers, and other stakeholders. The Media and Communications Office &mdash; the unit responsible for the site &mdash; decided to rebuild the Corporate site from the ground up. The new site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was a secondary developer on this project.

I was tasked in a support and bug fixing role for the Corporate site. I assisted with CSS changes, with Drupal theme changes, with module development, and with configuration / deployment.
