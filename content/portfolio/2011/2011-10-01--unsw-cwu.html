The UNSW CWU (Central Web Unit) is a new group within the University, responsible for managing and developing the University's web presence. The CWU decided to build a new site to promote itself, using Django. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a> (working almost exclusively via the CWU), I was a secondary developer on this project.

I was tasked in a support and bug fixing role for the CWU site. I assisted with CSS changes, with Django templating changes, with app development, and with configuration / deployment.
