The UNSW Newsroom is the primary source of news about the University, particularly for journalists and external academics. The Media and Communications Office &mdash; the unit responsible for the site &mdash; decided to rebuild the Newsroom from the ground up. The new site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was a secondary developer on this project.

I was tasked in a support and bug fixing role for the Newsroom. I assisted with CSS changes, with Drupal theme changes, with module development, and with configuration / deployment.
