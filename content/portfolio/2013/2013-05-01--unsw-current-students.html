The UNSW Current Students website (also known as the "Student Gateway") is a new site commissioned by the University's central administration, that aims to provide relevant links and information for all things student-related. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site's most distinctive feature, is that it allows direct sign-on to several University services (e.g. MyUNSW, UNSW Identity Manager), from a login form on the front page. The site also contains a large amount of hierarchical informational pages, and as such, the front-end elements (e.g. header / sidebar menus, breadcrumbs) are built to accommodate both a large quantity of pages, and a deep level of nesting (up to 8 levels).
