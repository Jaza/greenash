UNSW Continuing Legal Education is a program run by the University's Faculty of Law, and it has the purpose of providing legal professionals seminars and accredited courses relevant to their ongoing careers. The Faculty commissioned a new web site to replace the program's ageing web presence. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site's main feature is the ability for users to sign up to courses / seminars, including the handling of online payment. The Drupal Commerce module powers most of this functionality (shopping cart, checkout system, etc). I wrote a custom Drupal Commerce payment gateway module, to handle payment using the <a href="http://www.unilink.com.au/index.php/solutions/onestopsecure/">OneStop</a> gateway, the same gateway that the legacy CLE site used.
