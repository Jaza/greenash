The UNSW Workplace Mental Health Research Program aims to develop research focused on the mental health needs of NSW front line emergency workers. The Program commissioned a web site to give itself an online presence for the first time. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site is a fairly standard UNSW Drupal affair: it has a news section; a projects listing; a publications archive; and a staff listing.
