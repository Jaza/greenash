Swellnet is a service that provides surf reports and forecasts, along with other surf resources, and that supports an online surfers' community. They recently decided to redesign and rebuild their ageing web site. The new site is built with Drupal. As a freelance contractor for <a href="http://thislittleduck.com/">This Little Duck</a> (the company managing the rebuild), I provided development support for this project.

In particular, I was the lead developer for the new wave / wind forecasting engine that now powers the Swellnet surf forecasts. I decided to build the "Wave App" using Silex (a Symfony2 distribution). The App implements the forecast algorithm, which was provided to me in pseudo-code format. The App's main task is to ingest <a href="http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/wavewatch/wavewatch.shtml">WaveWatch 3</a> forecast data files (which are in a custom plain-text format), to process them using the Swellnet algorithm, and to output Swellnet forecasts (which it does in JSON format).

I also assisted with the Drupal-based development of the new Swellnet website. For example, I built the "super lightbox" carousel functionality for the image gallery pages.
