The CRC (Cooperative Research Centre) for Low Carbon Living is "a national research and innovation hub that seeks to enable a globally competitive low carbon built environment sector". The Centre is based at UNSW, although it is an independent entity and is part of the Australian Government's CRC initiative. The Centre commissioned a new web site to replace its ageing web presence. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

The site is a fairly standard Drupal affair: it features a news / events archive; a research projects / activities listing; and various informational pages. It also feeds in blog posts from the Centre's separate blog web site (using the Drupal Feeds module), and it links to recent blog posts from the front page.
