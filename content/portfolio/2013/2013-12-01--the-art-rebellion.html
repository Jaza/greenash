The Art Rebellion is "art for small people" - it's the one-person business of Gabi Wynhausen, who runs childrens' art classes in Sydney. Gabi had previously built herself a simple blog site using Google Blogger, but she wanted a more comprehensive online presence. So, as an independent freelancer, I built her a new site using Django / Mezzanine / Cartridge.

The site's main feature is the ability for users to sign up to lessons, and to pay for lessons online. The e-commerce functionality is handled by <a href="http://cartridge.jupo.org/">Cartridge</a>, and payment is handled by PayPal WPS. Cartridge doesn't have PayPal WPS support as such, but <a href="http://greenash.net.au/thoughts/2014/03/using-paypal-wps-with-cartridge-mezzanine-django/">I got the two of them to play nice</a>, with some tweaking. The site also allows eBooks to be purchased and downloaded securely.
