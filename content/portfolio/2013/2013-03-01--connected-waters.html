The UNSW Connected Waters Initiative is a research centre focused on groundwater investigation and education in Australia. The centre commissioned a new web site to replace their ageing web presence. The site is built with Drupal. In my capacity as a full-time contractor at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/">UNSW</a>, I was the lead developer on this project.

Along with the typical content associated with a research centre, such as news articles and staff profiles, the Connected Waters site also boasts an impressive collection of academic and educational resources, including fact sheets, in-depth articles, and videos. Migrating this content from the legacy site into Drupal was a large task in itself.
