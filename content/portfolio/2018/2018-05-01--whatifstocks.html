What If Stocks is a little web app that I built, to answer the question: based on a start and end date, and a pool of stocks and historical prices, what would have been the best stocks to invest in?

It's a simple Flask app, with a front-end that uses stock Bootstrap for styling and components. The main custom feature that I built, was the ability to download and import historical stock prices using the <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alpha Vantage</a> API.
