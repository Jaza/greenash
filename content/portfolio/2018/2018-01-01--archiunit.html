In partnership with my good friend Liam Filson, we developed the concept for, and we founded the business known as, ArchiUnit. ArchiUnit is a directory of products and suppliers, that architects may use in their specification documents. Liam took charge of sales, marketing, and design, while I took charge of the technical side. The app is built with Flask. As this is a side business, I built the app completely in my own spare time.

ArchiUnit boasts an impressive search engine, with funky features such as searching by colour. It allows suppliers to register, to create a company profile, and to list their products in the directory.
