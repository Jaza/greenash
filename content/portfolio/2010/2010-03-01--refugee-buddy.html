Refugee Buddy is a tool that allows members of the Australian public to volunteer to help people in their community who are refugees from another country. It maintains a database of volunteers, which is then made accessible to refugee welfare organisations. Volunteers are "matched up" with refugees by the welfare organisation personnel.

This is a Django site, and my chief contribution to it was templating, as well as working on the registration handler. It was <a href="http://greenash.net.au/thoughts/2010/03/refugee-buddy-a-project-of-ozsicamp-sydney-2010/">built in one weekend</a> (by a team of volunteers) as part of <a href="http://www.asix.org.au/sicamp">Social Innovation Camp Sydney 2010</a>, and it was the winner out of the eight projects at the camp.
