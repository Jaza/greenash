Doyle Edwards Anderson is a commercial law firm operating in Sydney. They specialise in commercial, construction and property law. I built this site in partnership with <a href="http://au.linkedin.com/in/markelizondo">Mark Elizondo</a>, who took charge of all the visual design and graphics. The site was developed using a simple, custom PHP foundation, which served as a light page routing and templating system. The site consists of several informational pages, as well as a contact form.
