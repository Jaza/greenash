iCarInsurance is one of several "hot domains" owned and operated by <a href="http://www.domainpartners.com.au/">Domain Partners</a>, an Australian-based domain development company. The site contains information and user reviews about a range of Australian car insurance companies. I was hired as a freelancer to build the site. It was developed using vanilla WordPress, along with a third-party theme that was customised.
