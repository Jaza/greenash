Art Month is a month-long series of art exhibitions and other events, held in venues around Sydney. It's a non-profit organisation, sponsored by various groups (commercial, government, and other), and supported by the City of Sydney.

<a href="http://digitaleskimo.net/">Digital Eskimo</a> was contracted to build the web site for Art Month 2010. The site was built in Django, and it was focused primarily around the display of events. I was the assistant developer for the site. I built a large number of the front-end templates, and I also coded parts of the back-end, including the site's subscription feature that integrates with the <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/">Campaign Monitor</a> mailing list service.
