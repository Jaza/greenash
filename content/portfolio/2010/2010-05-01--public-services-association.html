The Public Services Association is a union that represents employees of the NSW government, and other related personnel. <a href="http://digitaleskimo.net/">Digital Eskimo</a> was contracted by the PSA, to build a new sub-site with facilities for online membership application and online fee payment. The membership sub-site is built with Django, and as an employee of DE, I was the assistant developer for the project.

I built the front-end templates for the forms, with the help of the <a href="http://sprawsm.com/uni-form/">Uni-Form</a> framework to ensure good form accessibility and consistency. I also worked on the forms' back-end integration with the <a href="http://www.securepay.com.au/">SecurePay</a> Australian payment gateway.
