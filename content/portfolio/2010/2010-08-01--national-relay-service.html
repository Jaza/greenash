The National Relay Service is a free government service for deaf or speech-impaired persons. <a href="http://digitaleskimo.net/">Digital Eskimo</a> was contracted by the NRS, to re-design and re-develop their ageing corporate website. The site is built with Django, and as an employee of DE, I was the lead developer for the project. I built most of the site's templates and back-end functionality.

Most of the site is relatively static informational content. As such, in developing the new site, the focus was to improve the admin experience in terms of managing navigation, managing the page hierarchy, replacing content images, and editing blocks of text. Additionally, the search functionality is powered by Apache Solr via Django's Haystack app.
