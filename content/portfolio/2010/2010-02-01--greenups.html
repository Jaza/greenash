GreenUps is a monthly gathering of sustainability-minded people &mdash; <em>"Sydney green drinks"</em>, as its slogan says. It's organised by a small team, that includes <a href="http://digitaleskimo.net/about/who-we-are/dave-gravina">Dave Gravina</a>, my boss at <a href="http://digitaleskimo.net/">Digital Eskimo</a>. While employed by DE, I built a new WordPress-powered site for GreenUps. The site is a simple listing of upcoming and recently-held monthly events.
