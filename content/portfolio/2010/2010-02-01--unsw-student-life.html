Student Life is a promotional site designed to showcase the lifestyle benefits of being a student at Sydney's UNSW. <a href="http://digitaleskimo.net/">Digital Eskimo</a> was contracted by the UNSW marketing unit to design and build this site. It's built with Django, and as an employee of DE, I was the assistant developer for the project. I built the majority of the site's templates, and I also built parts of the back-end.
