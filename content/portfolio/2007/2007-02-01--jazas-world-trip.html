I made this site in order to keep a blog of my 12-month round-the-world backpacking trip for 2007. The site is built on Drupal 4.7, and has a number of interesting features, such as <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jaza/">Flickr integration</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google maps</a> integration, and display of categories in a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/tagadelic">tag cloud</a>.

The design is influenced by that of GreenAsh itself, and it also makes heavy use of gradient fades, rounded corners, and cute, cartoonish presentational images. Apart from user comments, the content on this site is all written by myself. This is a personal hobby site, and one that I'm very proud of.
