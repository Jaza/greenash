The Cancer Survivors Network is an online support community run by the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/">American Cancer Society</a>. The site was formerly powered by a home-grown <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, and it stored its data in a custom database schema to match. With the help of veteran consultant <a href="http://drupal.org/moshe">Moshe Weitzman</a>, the <abbr title="Cancer Survivors Network">CSN</abbr> site is now being completely rebuilt, and is being powered by Drupal.

Moshe brought me on board to help out with the task of migrating the data out of the old CSN database, and into the standard Drupal database schema. I was chosen for this task because of my work in developing the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/importexportapi">Import / Export API</a>, as part of the <a href="http://drupal.org/google-summer-of-code-2006">Google Summer of Code 2006</a>. I used the Import / Export API to help write a migration script for the user accounts and the forum threads on the site.
