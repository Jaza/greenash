Citect is a software company that produces <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA">SCADA</a> (and related) solutions for industrial companies, such as manufacturers. I spent over 2 months working full-time at Citect's headquarters, here in Sydney Australia, working on their web site, which is built on the <a href="http://joomla.org/">Joomla!</a> <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>. I generally prefer to work with <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> when it comes to CMSes, but in this case, the stars were aligned (so to speak) in such a way that I couldn't refuse this job.

I helped Citect in migrating key functionality out of their aging <a href="http://www.squiz.net/mysource">MySource</a> sub-site, and into their Joomla!-based main site. I used and customised Joomla! extensions such as <a href="http://virtuemart.net/">VirtueMart</a> (for E-Commerce) and <a href="http://www.mambodocman.com/">DocMan</a> (for download management) in order to do this. I also wrote scripts to allow for data migration out of MySource, and I set up a new staging and deployment environment for the site.
