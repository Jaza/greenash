Hampy is a non-profit organisation based in Cusco, Peru, whose main mission is to provide volunteer and study opportunities to foreign visitors in the area, and thus to help local communities with a number of important projects. Hampy's previous web site was written using basic HTML, with a small amount of <a href="http://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> for server-side includes of common page template elements. The site was being maintained by hand, using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/">Adobe Dreamweaver</a>, which was less than ideal for the non-technical administrators of the organisation. Information architecture, design usability, internationalisation, asset management, and maintainability were all in need of improvement.

While <a href="http://worldtrip.greenash.net.au/locations/peru/cusco">travelling in Cusco as part of my world trip</a>, I spent three weeks working to completely revamp the Hampy web site. I designed a new layout for the site, worked with the organisation to design a new site map, and gave the site a brand-new, <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>-powered backend. The new site has such features as: easy adding and updating of page content; generation of summary tables listing the organisation's current projects; easy management of page translations (the whole site is in English, Spanish, and Dutch); and ability for alumni volunteers to register and to submit feedback, and to have their profiles and feedback listed in a directory. I developed the new site as a volunteer for Hampy, free of charge, and on location in Cusco, Peru.
