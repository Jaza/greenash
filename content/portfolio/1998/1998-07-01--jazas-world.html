This is the first site that I ever made, and to this day it is my ongoing pet project. Jaza's World is currently in its 5th incarnation. It contains a number of ever-growing archives, including the gallery, the library, and the interests sections.

The first version of Jaza's World was released in 1998, and each new version has seen a change in the design, the structure, and even the location of the site. In January 2007, the release of version 5 saw Jaza's World: find a new home here at GreenAsh; gain a conversion to tableless, standards-compliant design; and convert to being dynamic and database-driven (built on <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, of course) for the first time.
