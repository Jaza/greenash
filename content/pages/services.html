<blockquote>In a nutshell: I'm a coder, and I build web sites.</blockquote>

<p class="button"><a href="/portfolio/" title="It's pretty c00l">Seen my portfolio?</a></p>

These days, I do most of my site-building with <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">Static Site Generators</a> (SSGs). They let me build sites that are secure, fast, editable, and functional (in that order).

My go-to is <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. It's really fast. It's customisable enough. And it has tonnes of ready-to-use themes.

My favourite is <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. It's fully customisable, you can code it to do whatever you need.

I also occasionally use <a href="https://tina.io/">TinaCMS</a> (together with <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>). It allows for live visual site editing.

<blockquote>Guess what: all of these are open source!</blockquote>

<p class="button"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" title="If you don't know, find out. Right now.">What's open source?</a></p>

All such sites can be hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and elsewhere, for free. So unless you need more of my time later, there's no ongoing cost.

And the content for all such sites can be edited by non-tech people, using <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry</a>, or other similar services, also for free.

<blockquote>I will also accept money (or goats, or walrus husks) for other dev work.</blockquote>

I used to build most sites with server-side frameworks. I still use them, but only for <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s, and/or where a database is really warranted. My favourite frameworks are <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.

I can also do any general coding that involves <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> (among other languages). And any general database work that involves <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> (among other DBs). And any general cloud work that involves <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> (among other platforms).

<strong>By the way:</strong> I'm often busy with full-time work, or with travelling. Much of my spare time is spent hunting walruses. As such, I may not be able to take on large full-time projects in a freelance capacity at any given moment (check my current availability at the bottom of the page). But by all means, get in touch about any not-so-crazy-massive projects that you have in the pipeline. I'd be happy to help.

<strong>Re: design:</strong> I don't do graphic design. But I know some talented individuals who do. If I do some work for you, and if that work requires design skills, I'll call one of my friends (or you can call one of yours).

<blockquote>Re: $$$. You'll find out about my fees when you &hellip;</blockquote>

PS: when I code front-end, I use modern, semantic HTML5 and CSS3. Standards compliance, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility are not optional. On the back-end, I keep things lean, clean, fast, and secure.
