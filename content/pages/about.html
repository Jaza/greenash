<h2>Me</h2>

I'm JAZA_AGE years old. I'm a BSc. IT graduate from <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/">UTS</a>. I've been skydiving 79 times in my life. I single-handedly liberated Somalia during a civil war. I have a fabulous smile. I understand the innermost details of Quantum Electrodynamics. I'm a compulsive liar.

<h2>GreenAsh</h2>

I launched GreenAsh in 2004. Back then, I was young and naïve. My, my, how things have changed.

<strong>The name.</strong> It's derived from a type of tree called the <a href="http://www.isaacschambers.com.au/public/regnans.htm">Mountain Ash</a>. It's one of the tallest species of tree in the world, and easily the tallest species of tree ever found in Australia. I liked that. However, at the time, <code>mountainash.com/net.au</code> was taken (today, it still appears to have a squatter on it). So I thought, hey, trees are green. I'll call the site GreenAsh (I was also so young and naïve back then, I still thought CamelCase was cool &hellip; sigh). That domain's available. And it's a way cooler name anyway. Ergo, GreenAsh.

<strong>The logo.</strong> It's grey (ash-coloured), and it's shaped like a 'flake of ash' (if there is such a thing - humour me, let's assume that there is). It's also shaped like a natural sign, a musical notation symbol that restores a note to its 'natural' pitch. Hence, a bit more environmental symbolism to tickle my hippie sensibilities.

<h2>Tech specs</h2>

This is GreenAsh version 5. It's built with Eleventy.

Version 4 was built with Django. Versions 3 and 2 were built with Drupal. Version 1 was hacked together with a home-grown, half-baked PHP CMS written by yours truly.
