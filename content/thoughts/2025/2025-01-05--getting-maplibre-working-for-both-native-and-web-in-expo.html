title: Getting MapLibre working for both native and web in Expo
date: 2025-01-05
teaser: |-
  I've been dabbling of late in building a mobile app with <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> + <a href="https://expo.dev/">Expo</a>. One of the things that attracted me most to Expo, is that &ndash; on top of the "write once, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55113505/is-it-sufficient-to-learn-only-react-native-for-building-ios-and-android-apps">run on iOS and Android</a>" claim of React Native &ndash; Expo claims to also let an app run seamlessly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative/comments/1204gzr/is_expo_ready_to_support_web_platform_as_well/">on the web</a>. Anyway, as it turns out (surprise surprise &ndash; not!), neither of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36871651">those claims</a> are particularly aligned with reality. I found this out &ndash; with the claim of "run on native and web" &ndash; as soon as I wanted to add a simple map to my app.

  Below is my humble lil' guide to getting <a href="https://maplibre.org/">MapLibre</a> working for both native and web in Expo. Note: if you want to skip the step-by-step shpiel, and you just want a working example with all the code, feel free to head straight to the <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/expo-maplibre-native-plus-web-demo">Expo MapLibre native + web demo</a> on GitHub.
