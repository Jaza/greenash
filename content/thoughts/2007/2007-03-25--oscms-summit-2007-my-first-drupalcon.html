  I've just finished off two days down at the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> headquarters in Sunnyvale, where the <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">OSCMS Summit 2007</a> was held, and where I experienced my first ever <a href="http://drupalcon.org/">DrupalCon</a>.

I've just finished off two days down at the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> headquarters in Sunnyvale, where the <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">OSCMS Summit 2007</a> was held, and where I experienced my first ever <a href="http://drupalcon.org/">DrupalCon</a>. You can read about my experiences by browsing the <a href="http://worldtrip.greenash.net.au/tags/drupalcon">posts tagged with DrupalCon on my world trip site</a>; and you can download the slides for <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/node/275">my presentation on site structuring and navigation in Drupal</a> right here.

I believe that someone was videoing my presentation, but I'm not sure if the video is online yet, or if it will be; and if it is online, I don't know where. I also don't know if I'm supposed to be posting my slides to some official spot, rather than just posting them here, where you can find them through <a href="http://drupal.org/planet">Planet Drupal</a>. So if anyone knows the answers to these things, please post your answers here as comments. Anyway, glad you found this, and enjoy the slides.
