      "comment": "There are a number of fairings and velomobiles available in North America but no full shells for a mountain bike or commuter diamond frame bike. The Honda Helix project by Craig Vetter has much information on aerodynamics and body construction. See the covered scooters coming out of China and the BMW C1.\n\nI am working on a project bike using foam bulkheads, aluminum angle spars, nylon tubing stiffeners and a skin made from 25mm hex steel mesh laminated between plastic tarp material. <a href=\"mailto:grantconnor@yahoo.com\">Contact me</a> for details and pictures.\n\nElmira, New York USA"
