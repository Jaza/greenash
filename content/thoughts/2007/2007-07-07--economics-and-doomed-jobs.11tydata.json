      "comment": "regarding the textile industry comment : many people are supporting the local craft industries where hand made items are made. they often are more expensive though are more unique too than machine made mass-produced wares. it's important to support these also to keep local cultures alive and to assist some of the minorities eg women in 'developing' countries. even in the West there's a shift taking place. check out etsy.com - just one example where hand crafted goods in the West are sold. their site is doing well and many of the contributers gave up jobs and are earning a living from craft/art. if more people valued the time/effort put into locally, hand-made goods there could be an even larger global shift away from mass produced goods."
