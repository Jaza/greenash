Thank you.\n\n<code>process.nexTick()</code> is useless, you are only going to differ the execution.\n\nBut, there is a way: by \"spawning\" your task, you can run your \"Fibonacci\" code in another thread (child_process). Just, don't forget to kill the thread. \n\nLimitation: can be expensive with memory usage if you are doing that a lot."
