      "comment": "Ive read this embarrassing \"essay\" of yours and couldnt help commenting, first of all YPF should have never been privatised like it was in the 90s during Menems corrupt government, no country in the world have privatised their estrategical resources, expropiation is contempled in most of countries constitutions and Argentina should have nationalisated it a long time ago.\n\n2nd - Falklands.. \"a sovereign territory of another nation\" really? who told you that? just in case you dont know it Falklands is a colony and Argentina has been claiming the islands since they were stolen by the English in 1833.\n\nYou surely wish you could steal our land and resources like you have always done, (im not only talkig about Argentina, but all Latin American countries, you are probably against popular governments like Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, etc), you hate the fact that Latin American countries are taking care of their own resources, our economies are growing and countries you defend cant do anything about it.\n\nAs for the rest.. que onda? what a load of old rubbish, seriously Im used to read nonsense about Argentina, but this is too much, you clearly dont know anything about Argentina nor Argentines, you are either lying or getting everything wrong. Pity.\n\nBtw... keep your patronising attitude to yourself, its vomitive."
