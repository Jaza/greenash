Turns out that there was indeed an issue, the default <code>$body</code> field wasn't coming through, as its internal name doesn't begin with <code>field_</code>, and so it was conflicting with the <code>body</code> key already in the preprocess <code>$vars</code> array.\n\nI've now fixed this - please download version 1.1 of Template Field Variables, and it should all work for you."
