title: An autop Django template filter
date: 2010-05-30
teaser: |-
  <a href="http://ma.tt/scripts/autop/"><code>autop</code></a> is a script that was first written for WordPress by Matt Mullenweg (the WordPress founder). All WordPress blog posts are filtered using <code>wpautop()</code> (unless you install an additional plug-in to disable the filter). The function was also <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/_filter_autop">ported to Drupal</a>, and it's enabled by default when entering body text into Drupal nodes. As far as I'm aware, <code>autop</code> has never been ported to a language other than PHP. Until now.

  In the process of <a href="/thoughts/2010/05/introducing-greenash-4/">migrating this site from Drupal to Django</a>, I was surprised to discover that not only Django, but also Python in general, lacks any linebreak filtering function (official or otherwise) that's anywhere near as intelligent as <code>autop</code>. The built-in Django <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#linebreaks"><code>linebreaks</code></a> filter converts all single newlines to <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tags, and all double newlines to <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags, completely irrespective of HTML block elements such as <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>. This was a fairly major problem for me, as I was migrating a lot of old content over from Drupal, and that content was all formatted in <code>autop</code> style. Plus, I'm used to writing content in that way, and I'd like to continue writing content in that way, whether I'm in a PHP environment or not.

  Therefore, I've ported Drupal's <code>_filter_autop()</code> function to Python, and implemented it as a Django template filter. From the limited testing I've done, the function appears to be working just as well in Django as it does in Drupal. You can find the function below.

</code></pre>

<strong>Update (31 May 2010):</strong> added the "Extra (not ported from Drupal) to escape the contents of code blocks" part of the code.

To use this filter in your Django templates, simply save the code above in a file called <code>autop.py</code> (or anything else you want) in a <code>templatetags</code> directory within one of your installed apps. Then, just declare <code>&lcub;% load autop %&rcub;</code> at the top of your templates, and filter your markup variables with something like <code>&lcub;&lcub; object.content|autop &rcub;&rcub;</code>.

Note that this is pretty much a direct port of the Drupal / PHP function into Django / Python. As such, it's probably not as efficient nor as Pythonic as it could be. However, it seems to work quite well. Feedback and comments are welcome.
