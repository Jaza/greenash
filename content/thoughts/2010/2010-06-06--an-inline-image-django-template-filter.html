title: An inline image Django template filter
date: 2010-06-06
teaser: |-
  Adding image fields to a Django model is easy, thanks to the built-in ImageField class. Auto-resizing uploaded images is also a breeze, courtesy of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sorl-thumbnail/">sorl-thumbnail</a> and its forks/variants. But what about embedding resized images inline within text content? This is a very common use case for bloggers, and it's a final step that seems to be missing in Django at the moment.

  Having recently migrated this site over from Drupal, my old blog posts had inline images embedded using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/img_assist">image assist</a>. Images could be inserted into an arbitrary spot within a text field by entering a token, with a syntax of <code>[img_assist nid=123 ... ]</code>. I wanted to be able to continue embedding images in roughly the same fashion, using a syntax as closely matching the old one as possible.

  So, I've written a simple template filter that parses a text block for tokens with a syntax of <code>&lsqb;thumbnail image-identifier&rsqb;</code>, and that replaces every such token with the image matching the given identifier, resized according to a pre-determined width and height (by sorl-thumbnail), and formatted as an image tag with a caption underneath. The code for the filter is below.

Images could be inserted into an arbitrary spot within a text field by entering a token, with a syntax of <code>[img_assist nid=123 ... ]</code>. I wanted to be able to continue embedding images in roughly the same fashion, using a syntax as closely matching the old one as possible.

So, I've written a simple template filter that parses a text block for tokens with a syntax of <code>&lsqb;thumbnail image-identifier&rsqb;</code>, and that replaces every such token with the image matching the given identifier, resized according to a pre-determined width and height (by sorl-thumbnail), and formatted as an image tag with a caption underneath. The code for the filter is below.

<pre class="python"><code>import re

from django import template
from django.template.defaultfilters import stringfilter

from sorl.thumbnail.main import DjangoThumbnail

from models import InlineImage

register = template.Library()

regex = re.compile(r'\[thumbnail (?P<identifier>[\-\w]+)\]')


@register.filter
@stringfilter
def inline_thumbnails(value):
    new_value = value
    it = regex.finditer(value)
    for m in it:
        try:
            image = InlineImage.objects.get(identifier=identifier)
            thumbnail = DjangoThumbnail(image.image, (500, 500))
            new_value = new_value.replace(m.group(), '<img src="%s%s" width="%d" height="%d" alt="%s" /><p><em>%s</em></p>' % ('http://mysite.com', thumbnail.absolute_url, thumbnail.width(), thumbnail.height(), image.title, image.title))
        except InlineImage.DoesNotExist:
            pass
    return new_value
</code></pre>

This code belongs in a file such as <code>appname/templatetags/inline_thumbnails.py</code> within your Django project directory. It also assumes that you have an <code>InlineImage</code> model that looks something like this (in your app's <code>models.py</code> file):

<pre class="python"><code>from django.db import models

class InlineImage(models.Model):
    created         = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    modified        = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    title           = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    image           = models.ImageField(upload_to='uploads/images')
    identifier      = models.SlugField(unique=True)

    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.title
        ordering = ('-created',)
</code></pre>

Say you have a model for your site's blog posts, called <code>Entry</code>. The main body text field for this model is <code>content</code>. You could upload an <code>InlineImage</code> with identifier <code>hokey-pokey</code>. You'd then embed the image into the body text of a blog post like so:

<pre class="html"><code><p>You put your left foot in,
You put your left foot out,
You put your left foot in,
And you shake it all about.</p>

[thumbnail hokey-pokey]

<p>You do the Hokey Pokey and you turn around,
That's what it's all about.</p>
</code></pre>

To render the blog post content with the thumbnail tokens converted into actual images, simply filter the variable in your template, like so:

<pre class="django"><code>LEFTCURLYBRACKET% load inline_thumbnails %RIGHTCURLYBRACKET

LEFTCURLYBRACKETLEFTCURLYBRACKET entry.content|inline_thumbnails|safe RIGHTCURLYBRACKETRIGHTCURLYBRACKET
</code></pre>

The code here is just a simple example &mdash; if you copy it and adapt it to your own needs, you'll probably want to add a bit more functionality to it. For example, the token could be extended to support specifying image alignment (left/right), width/height per image, caption override, etc. But I didn't particularly need any of these things, and I wanted to keep my code simple, so I've omitted those features from my filter.
