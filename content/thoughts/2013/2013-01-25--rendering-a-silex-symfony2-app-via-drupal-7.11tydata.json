      "comment": "I've just finished a project similar to the one I did back in Jan (in Silex - hence this article), only this time I decided to use Symfony2 Standard Edition instead of Silex.\n\nBased on the Drupal integration code from my Silex app, this time round I built a Symfony2 bundle, which provides the integration functionality in a more convenient and more reusable form.\n\nYou can find the <a href=\"https://github.com/Jaza/DrupalIntegrationBundle\">Jaza/DrupalIntegrationBundle code</a> on GitHub (also <a href=\"https://packagist.org/packages/jaza/drupal-integration-bundle\">listed on Packagist</a>). The README has all the installation / configuration instructions you should need (let me know if anything is missing or buggy). Hope this new bundle is of use!"
