      "comment": "Hi.\n\nEarlier this year we drove from Reykjavik to Capetown via west Africa (and a couple of ferries) in an Ex British army truck with 17 people.\n\nIn 2015 we will do the trip again and after drive the truck up the east of Africa from Cape to Cairo ... probably will take 5 months from Cape to Cairo.\n\nLike your info on the current state of the rail network ... I think I saw a documentary a couple of years ago of an African American father and daughter who took the train all the way (well most).\n\nI can testify that Africa is a very difficult continent to cross, not just with transport and non existent road and rail conections but politically with visa ... we only just made it across Africa with the visa situations, and I think in 1976 it would have been impossable in Uganda and South Sudan."
