      "comment": "I think you exaggerate the security challenges. A firewall/DDoS protection is nice but not necessary for personal websites. You really have to actively configure a service to listen on a public port. Also 99.99% of the maintenance is <code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade</code> - certificates are updated automatically.\n\nBut I am not denying your use case. You have a point."

Code and text content is all in Git repos, media assets are all in S3, I have at-home backups, and I'm able to regularly sync it all.\n\nI no longer own the systems to which that data is deployed. But if those systems are taken away from me tomorrow, I've lost nothing, I can re-deploy it all elsewhere."

      "comment": "Why not host on github pages with custom domain as opposed to netlify / cloudflare? I moved most of mine there after moving to hugo for most things for a few years now. I would not choose s3 either, you don't need the lock-in for a cloud service provider. You could simply use github actions to create backups for you and store them anywhere that gives you free storage like dropbox etc. or keep them in a versioned releases branch."

      "comment": "<blockquote>Why not host on github pages with custom domain as opposed to netlify / cloudflare?</blockquote>\n\nI could have gone with GitHub Pages instead of Netlify (and I don't use CloudFlare Pages). Maybe I got lured in by Netlify's marketing buzz (although I'm paying Netlify $0, and I don't foresee myself ever paying them any money). I like Netlify's admin UI (not that it's all that different to the admin UI's of GitHub Pages and co). I like Netlify Forms (as long as I stay under its rather small free limit), and Netlify Functions (even though they're just a thin layer on top of AWS Lambda). I appreciate that Netlify built and open-sourced Eleventy (my favourite SSG), as well as Netlify CMS (even though I prefer Forestry). There you go, my reasons for hosting with Netlify! Plus, I'm not locked in, I could switch from Netlify to GitHub Pages, or another competitor, any time, I estimate it could be done in a matter of hours."

I use different services, but the same result: I get to sleep at night without worrying about security.\n\nIf your S3 burden becomes too much, you might look at Backblaze. I use them for my backup needs, storing ~160G for $0.75 per month.\n\nThere&#039;s also CloudFlare&#039;s S3-alike which can be a proxy for S3 (your data lives on S3, but every pull past the first is served by CloudFlare at a far lower cost)"

      "comment": "Yes, IMHO in some specfic areas like web page host or source code in git, they are good enough. Hence SAAS/LAAS providers ensuring security and availability. \r\n\r\nOnce it comes to storage, self-host is still most cheap option.\r\n\r\nAnd some other things like docker image coded by yourself, there is still no SAAS/LAAS to run with, cost is same to VPS but you get less control (image get a k8s service for 10$ and ingress for another 5$).\r\n\r\nSAAS/LAAS is good but vendor are only tier their hard/OS more apart and try sale more money on. Personal use might cheap, when it comes to bigger scale, things will change."
