You really have to actively configure a service to listen on a public port. Also 99.99% of the maintenance is <code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade</code> - certificates are updated automatically.\n\nBut I am not denying your use case. You have a point."

Code and text content is all in Git repos, media assets are all in S3, I have at-home backups, and I'm able to regularly sync it all.\n\nI no longer own the systems to which that data is deployed. But if those systems are taken away from me tomorrow, I've lost nothing, I can re-deploy it all elsewhere."
