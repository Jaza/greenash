      "comment": "Some good points, especially the last paragraph, but you're using a very narrow definition of 'fantasy' -- I think you're talking about the sub-genre called 'epic fantasy'. If you like Harry Potter, I recommend some of Diana Wynne Jones' great childrens' novels, definately fantastic, but often related to our world in some way, and much more creatively written. Also consider the Discworld books by Terry Pratchett; none but the earliest fit neatly into the framework you describe, as he has explored many aspects of fantasy over the series.\n\nYou can find fantasy detective stories, fantasy romances, fantasies set in industrialised worlds... just browse through some of the entries and subcategories at <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/279254' >Amazon</a>. Even many horror and scifi stories could be described as fantasy. I would define fantasy as a more extreme kind of fiction, where the author can substantially alter the nature of the world and its societies and history."

      "comment": "Yeah, epic fantasy is mainly what I was referring to in this article. They're the ones I've read the most, although I do have exposure to some other facets of the fantasy genre: for example, I have read quite a few of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, and find them to be a great read. Can't say I've read any 'industrialised worlds' type of fantasy book, though.\n\nThe Discworld books are a real asset to the fantasy genre, if you ask me, because they parody (among many other things) the \"fantasy formula\" that I described in this article, which gives readers a new angle that they might not have thought about just from reading books that adhere to the formula."
