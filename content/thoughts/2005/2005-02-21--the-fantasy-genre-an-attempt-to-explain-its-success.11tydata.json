      "comment": "Some good points, especially the last paragraph, but you're using a very narrow definition of 'fantasy' -- I think you're talking about the sub-genre called 'epic fantasy'. If you like Harry Potter, I recommend some of Diana Wynne Jones' great childrens' novels, definately fantastic, but often related to our world in some way, and much more creatively written. Also consider the Discworld books by Terry Pratchett; none but the earliest fit neatly into the framework you describe, as he has explored many aspects of fantasy over the series.\n\nYou can find fantasy detective stories, fantasy romances, fantasies set in industrialised worlds... just browse through some of the entries and subcategories at <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/279254' >Amazon</a>. Even many horror and scifi stories could be described as fantasy. I would define fantasy as a more extreme kind of fiction, where the author can substantially alter the nature of the world and its societies and history."
