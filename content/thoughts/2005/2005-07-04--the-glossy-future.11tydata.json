      "comment": "Very nice and well-written article Jaza!\n\nThe future will indeed be cool, and on top of all: very interesting. If you think about the fact that 100 years ago, there hardly didnt exist any cars, and now they are a common part of our everyday life (for most of us), you get the idea how fast things evolve - and it gets faster and faster...\n\nHow will the society evolve? Whats up with the large gab between the poor and the rich? Will the wealthy people live in a large metropolis/megapolis-style city and the rest of the population of our planet in the outland/desert?\n\nHow will future inovations and inventions influence our life?\n\nMan, there is so much to think of that I could spend probably all the time daydreaming :)"
