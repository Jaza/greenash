      "comment": "After reading the humorous post about the origins of a the phrase \"not enough room to swing a cat\", I couldn't help but wonder if the rooms in the <a href=\"http://www.ozkithomes.com.au\">kit homes NSW</a> friends bought are big enough to swing a cat in. Kit homes are the epitome of stylish modern dwellings so I am curious as to whether rooms are still made large enough to swing a cat if you wanted to (which I don't)! What an amazing expression but a little research actually doesn't uncover much about the origins of the expression.  Of course that doesn't stop it from creating a vivid mental image. But I got to wondering if it matters whether you bought a house like the OzKit Homes Balmoral (smallish home) or if you had to own a house like their Lifestyle 305 (much larger) to be able to freely swing a cat. Come to think of it, there is another expression to keep in mind: Curiosity killed the cat!"
