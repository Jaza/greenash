      "comment": "A friend attached a \"roof\" to  his Recumbent Trike with good results. It was more for sun protection than rain, but it seemed to be useful. Not quite as sexy as a velomobile body to be sure. but you CAN build a body from \"Coroplast\" or \"Coroflute\" which is basically plastic corrugated material (like cardboard, but plastic) that will help protect you from weather and make the bike faster.\n\nmark"
