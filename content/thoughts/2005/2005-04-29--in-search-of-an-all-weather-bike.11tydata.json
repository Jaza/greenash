Not quite as sexy as a velomobile body to be sure. but you CAN build a body from \"Coroplast\" or \"Coroflute\" which is basically plastic corrugated material (like cardboard, but plastic) that will help protect you from weather and make the bike faster.\n\nmark"

I once was researching human powered vehicles and kept coming across the word fairing and didn't have a clue what it meant. I eventually found out that they were bike coverings. Partial Fairings are like wind screens and full fairings cover the entire bike. there are manufacturers like Zzip and also examples of home made ones. They are usually made out of tent-like material."
