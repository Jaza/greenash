  During the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, virtually every nation <a href="https://anidonat.com/2013/04/21/capitalist-vs-communist/">in the world was affected</a>, either directly or indirectly, by the "red tide" of communism. Beginning with the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/100-years-on-from-the-russian-revolution-could-a-21st-century-revolt-bring-about-the-end-of-a8039896.html">Russian revolution in 1917</a>, and ostensibly ending with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/06/-sp-fall-berlin-wall-what-it-meant-to-be-there">close of the Cold War</a> in 1991 (but actually not having any clear end, because <a href="https://financesonline.com/10-most-recent-current-communist-nations-in-the-world/">several communist regimes remain</a> on the scene to this day), communism was and is the single <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/100-years-of-communism/">biggest political and economic phenomenon</a> of modern times.

  Communism &ndash; or, to be more precise, Marxism &ndash; made sweeping promises of a <a href="http://www.debate.org/opinions/communism-and-socialism-in-theory-are-ideal-forms-of-government">rosy utopian world</a> society: all people are equal; from each according to his ability, to each according to his need; the end of the bourgeoisie, the rise of the proletariat; and the end of poverty. In reality, the nature of the communist societies that emerged during the 20<sup>th</sup> century was <a href="https://fee.org/articles/communisms-legacy-tyranny-terror-and-torture/">far from this grandiose vision</a>.

  Communism obviously was not successful in terms of the most obvious measure: namely, its own longevity. The world's first and its longest-lived communist regime, the Soviet Union, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/photos-of-russia-1990s-after-the-collapse-of-the-soviet-union-2017-3/">well and truly collapsed</a>. The world's most populous country, the People's Republic of China, is stronger than ever, but effectively remains <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2017/10/17/time-for-the-chinese-communist-party-to-drop-communist-from-its-name/">communist in name only</a> (as does <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/22/vietnam-40-years-on-how-communist-victory-gave-way-to-capitalist-corruption">its southern neighbour, Vietnam</a>).

  However, this article does not seek to measure communism's success based on the survival rate of particular governments; nor does it seek to analyse (in any great detail) why particular regimes failed (and there's <a href="https://whistlinginthewind.org/2013/04/11/why-did-communism-fail-1-dictatorship/">no shortage</a> of <a href="https://www.learning-mind.com/why-did-communism-fail/">other articles</a> that do <a href="https://fee.org/articles/why-communism-failed/">analyse just that</a>). More important than whether the regimes themselves prospered or met their demise, is their legacy and their long-term impact on the societies that they presided over. So, how successful was the communism experiment, in actually improving the economic, political, and cultural conditions of the populations that experienced it?

<strong>Success:</strong>

<ul>
  <li class="listitem-yes"><strong>Health care in Cuba</strong> (internationally recognised as being <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/salim-lamrani/cubas-health-care-system-_b_5649968.html">one of the world's best</a> and most accessible public health care systems)</li>
  <li class="listitem-yes"><strong>The arts</strong> (<a href="http://artinrussia.org/post-soviet-theatre/">Soviet theatre</a> and <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/october/russian-dance-scholar-100413.html">Soviet ballet</a> received funding and support for many years, as <a href="http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/04/23/its-sunrise-in-cuba-will-the-light-reach-the-stage/">Cuban theatre still does</a>; despite severely limiting artistic freedom, most communist regimes did actually make the arts thrive with subsidies)</li>
  <li class="listitem-yes"><strong>Education</strong> (despite the heavy dose of propaganda in schools, almost all communist regimes have <a href="https://mdp.berkeley.edu/peter-myers-can-the-soviet-education-system-help-us-now/">massively improved</a> their populations' literacy rates, and have invested heavily in <a href="https://listverse.com/2016/02/18/10-positive-things-the-soviet-union-did/">more schools and universities</a>, and in universal access to them)</li>
  <li class="listitem-yes"><strong>Infrastructure</strong> (for example, the USSR built an <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/railroad-troops.htm">impressive railway</a> network, a <a href="http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1934-2/the-moscow-metro/">glorious metro in Moscow</a>, and numerous <a href="http://www.powermag.com/the-russian-power-revolution/?printmode=1">power stations</a>, although not all of amazing quality; and PR China has built an <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/2002/Oct/45861.htm">excellent highway network</a>, among many other things)</li>
  <li class="listitem-yes"><strong>Womens' rights</strong> (the USSR strongly promoted <a href="https://www.bolshevik.info/emancipation-women-russia.htm">women in the workforce</a>, as does <a href="http://hir.harvard.edu/article/?a=13799">China</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/world/americas/06iht-letter06.html">Cuba</a>; the Soviet Union was also a pioneer in <a href="http://factsanddetails.com/russia/People_and_Life/sub9_2a/entry-4995.html">legalised abortion</a>)</li>
  <li class="listitem-yes"><strong>Industrialisation</strong> (putting aside for a moment the enormous sacrifices made to achieve it, the fact is that the <a href="http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1684/stalin-and-the-drive-to-industrialize-the-soviet-union">USSR</a>, <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/april-2016/chinas-rapid-rise-from-backward-agrarian-society-to-industrial-powerhouse-in-just-35-years">China</a>, and <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198776987.001.0001/acprof-9780198776987-chapter-12">Vietnam</a> transformed rapidly from agrarian economies into industrial powerhouses under communism, and they remain <a href="https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-industry-oil-gas-sanctions-economy/28621448.html">world industrial heavyweights</a> today)</li>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>

Personally, I have always considered myself quite a "leftie": I'm a supporter of socially progressive causes, and in particular, I've always been involved with environmental movements. However, I've never considered myself a socialist or a communist, and I hope that this brief article on communism reflects what I believe are my fairly balanced and objective views on the topic.

Based on my list of pros and cons above, I would quite strongly tend to conclude that, overall, the communism experiment of the 20<sup>th</sup> century was <strong>not</strong> successful at improving the economic, political, and cultural conditions of the populations that experienced it.

I'm reluctant to draw comparisons, because I feel that it's a case of <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/apples_and_oranges">apples and oranges</a>, and also because I feel that a pure analysis should judge communist regimes on their merits and faults, and on theirs alone. However, the fact is that, based on the items in my lists above, much more success has been achieved, and much less failure has occurred, in capitalist democracies, than has been the case in communist states (and the pinnacle has really been achieved in the world's socialist democracies). The <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/soren-petersen/the-nordic-model---a-life_b_11817538.html">Nordic Model</a> &ndash; and indeed the model of my own home country, Australia &ndash; demonstrates that a high quality of life and a high level of equality are attainable without going down the path of Marxist Communism; indeed, arguably those things are attainable <em>only</em> if Marxist Communism is avoided.

I hope you appreciate what I have endeavoured to do in this article: that is, to avoid the question of whether or not communist theory is fundamentally flawed; to avoid a religious rant about the "evils" of communism or of capitalism; and to avoid judging communism based on its means, and to instead concentrate on what ends it achieved. And I humbly hope that I have stuck to that plan laudably. Because if one thing is needed more than anything else in the arena of analyses of communism, it's clear-sightedness, and a focus on the hard facts, rather than religious zeal and ideological ranting.
