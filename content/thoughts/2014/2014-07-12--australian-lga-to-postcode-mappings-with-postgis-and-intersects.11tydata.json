      "comment": "@G. Re: \"some postcodes are in more than one LGA. How do you select the appropriate one?\" Well, that's the whole point - many of those postcodes really do belong to multiple LGAs. Officially and on the ground. So, for those postcodes, there is no \"appropriate one\", there's only an \"appropriate many\".\n\nIf you have more information, e.g. an exact street address, which yields a geographical point (not an area), then you can of course always map that to a single LGA. But with just a postcode, all you have is a (possibly large) geographical area, which may overlap with the areas of multiple LGAs."

      "comment": "UPDATE: due to a request that I received, I've created a new spreadsheet based on the latest ABS data sets (released in 2016). You can now access the new file <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oRgqNZ8CJ4G9otnAr1x6CgSuYolzC1chud9kRpjmofM\">Australian LGA postcode mappings (2016 data)</a>. Main changes, as far as I can see: areas that have no LGA are now included (listed as \"Unincorporated\"), including all of the ACT; the controversial NSW council amalgamations have happened, and this is now reflected in the data sets.\n\nAlso, when trying to generate the new mapping with PostGIS, I got an \"ERROR: GEOSIntersects: TopologyException: side location conflict\" for the polygons for the Circular Head LGA / the 7330 postcode in Tasmania. So, I excluded these problem areas from the auto-generated mapping, and per the info at http://www.geopostcodes.com/Circular_Head (and a few other similar web sites), I manually added \"Tasmania,Circular Head,7321\", \"Tasmania,Circular Head,7330\", and \"Tasmania,Circular Head,7331\" to the spreadsheet."

However, the ABS does publish suburbs geospatial data, same as it does for postcodes and LGAs, so it should be possible to generate a postcode-to-suburb mapping, or an LGA-to-suburb mapping, or even a three-way postcode-LGA-suburb mapping, similar to the postcode-to-LGA mapping that I generated."
