      "comment": "@G. Re: \"some postcodes are in more than one LGA. How do you select the appropriate one?\" Well, that's the whole point - many of those postcodes really do belong to multiple LGAs. Officially and on the ground. So, for those postcodes, there is no \"appropriate one\", there's only an \"appropriate many\".\n\nIf you have more information, e.g. an exact street address, which yields a geographical point (not an area), then you can of course always map that to a single LGA. But with just a postcode, all you have is a (possibly large) geographical area, which may overlap with the areas of multiple LGAs."
