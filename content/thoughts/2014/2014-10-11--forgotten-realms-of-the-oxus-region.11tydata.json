I am also terribly fascinated by the ancient cultures of Central Asia and would love to visit some places some day, but difficulties of travel are a stumbling block. Not only are many of these places off the beaten track in today's world, but also many of our fairy tales and epic stories in literature are based in or make references to places in this region. So for me it also has a fairytale-ish quality.\n\nCongratulating you on writing this fascinating article."
