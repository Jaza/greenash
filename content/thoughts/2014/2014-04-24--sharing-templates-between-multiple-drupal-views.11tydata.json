      "comment": "Nice tip! Just a side-note, you also get custom template suggestions when using the Views UI tagging feature; the tag name will be added as a suggestion. This way you can potentially re-use the same tpl for a bunch of views tagged with a common string without actually writing any code! :)"

      "comment": "You can do all of this from the UI w/o the need for adding template suggestions in a preprocess. You just need to edit your views and give them a common tag (Edit the view, then Edit View Name/Description, then add some tags). After add you tags, you can use the Theme Information link to see the list of new suggestions."

Seems like Views tagging is actually the way to go, instead of the technique that I described in this article (although both achieve the same result, tagging is easier and cleaner)."
