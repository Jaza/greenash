title: Storing Flask uploaded images and files on Amazon S3

teaser: |-
  <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> is still a relative newcomer in the world of Python frameworks (it recently celebrated its fifth birthday); and because of this, it's still sometimes trailing behind its <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">rivals</a> in terms of plugins to scratch a given itch. I recently discovered that this was the case, with storing and retrieving user-uploaded files on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>.

  For static files (i.e. an app's seldom-changing CSS, JS, and images), <a href="http://flask-assets.readthedocs.org/">Flask-Assets</a> and <a href="https://flask-s3.readthedocs.org/">Flask-S3</a> work together like a charm.

  Due to a pressing itch in one of my projects, I decided to rectify this situation somewhat. Over the past few weeks, I've whipped up a bunch of Python / Flask tidbits, to handle the features that I needed:

<h2>Using s3-saver</h2>

The key feature across most of this tool suite, is being able to use the same code for working with local and with S3-based files. Just change a single config option, or a single function argument, to switch from one to the other. This is critical to the way I need to work with files in my Flask projects: on my development environment, everything should be on the local filesystem; but on other environments (especially production), everything should be on S3. Others may have the same business requirements (in which case you're in luck). This is most evident with s3-saver.

Here's a sample of the typical code you might use, when working with s3-saver:

<pre class="python"><code>from io import BytesIO
from os import path

from flask import current_app as app
from flask import Blueprint
from flask import flash
from flask import redirect
from flask import render_template
from flask import url_for
from s3_saver import S3Saver

from project import db
from library.prefix_file_utcnow import prefix_file_utcnow
from foo.forms import ThingySaveForm
from foo.models import Thingy


mod = Blueprint('foo', __name__)


@mod.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def home():
    """Displays the Flask S3 Save Example home page."""

    model = Thingy.query.first() or Thingy()

    form = ThingySaveForm(obj=model)

    if form.validate_on_submit():
        image_orig = model.image
        image_storage_type_orig = model.image_storage_type
        image_bucket_name_orig = model.image_storage_bucket_name

        # Initialise s3-saver.
        image_saver = S3Saver(
            storage_type=app.config['USE_S3'] and 's3' or None,
            bucket_name=app.config['S3_BUCKET_NAME'],
            access_key_id=app.config['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],

            static_root_parent=path.abspath(
                path.join(app.config['PROJECT_ROOT'], '..')))

        form.populate_obj(model)

        if form.image.data:
            filename = prefix_file_utcnow(model, form.image.data)

            filepath = path.abspath(
                path.join(
                    path.join(

                    filename))

            # Best to pass in a BytesIO to S3Saver, containing the
            # contents of the file to save. A file from any source
            # (e.g. in a Flask form submission, a
            # werkzeug.datastructures.FileStorage object; or if
            # reading in a local file in a shell script, perhaps a
            # Python file object) can be easily converted to BytesIO.
            # This way, S3Saver isn't coupled to a Werkzeug POST
            # request or to anything else. It just wants the file.
            temp_file = BytesIO()
            form.image.data.save(temp_file)

            # Save the file. Depending on how S3Saver was initialised,
            # could get saved to local filesystem or to S3.

As is hopefully evident in the sample code above, the idea with s3-saver is that as little S3-specific code as possible is needed, when performing operations on a file. Just find, save, and delete files as usual, per the user's input, without worrying about the details of that file's storage back-end.

s3-saver uses the excellent Python <a href="https://boto.readthedocs.org/">boto library</a>, as well as Python's built-in file handling functions, so that you don't have to. As you can see in the sample code, you don't need to directly import either <code>boto</code>, or the file-handling functions such as <code>glob</code> or <code>os.remove</code>. All you need to import is <code>io.BytesIO</code>, and <code>os.path</code>, in order to be able to pass s3-saver the parameters that it needs.

<h2>Using url-for-s3</h2>

This is a simple utility function, that generates a URL to a given S3-based file. It's designed to match <code>flask.url_for</code> as closely as possible, so that one can be swapped out for the other with minimal fuss.

<pre class="python"><code>from __future__ import print_function

from flask import url_for
from url_for_s3 import url_for_s3

from project import db


class Thingy(db.Model):
    """Sample model for flask-s3-save-example."""

    id = db.Column(db.Integer(), primary_key=True)
    image = db.Column(db.String(255), default='')
    image_storage_type = db.Column(db.String(255), default='')
    image_storage_bucket_name = db.Column(db.String(255), default='')

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'A thingy'

    @property
    def image_url(self):
        from flask import current_app as app
        return (self.image
            and '%s%s' % (
                app.config['UPLOADS_RELATIVE_PATH'],
                self.image)
            or None)

    @property
    def image_url_storageaware(self):
        if not self.image:
            return None

        if not (
                self.image_storage_type
                and self.image_storage_bucket_name):
            return url_for(
                'static',
                filename=self.image_url,
                _external=True)

        if self.image_storage_type != 's3':
            raise ValueError((
                'Storage type "%s" is invalid, the only supported ' +
                'storage type (apart from default local storage) ' +
                'is s3.') % self.image_storage_type)

        return url_for_s3(
            'static',
            bucket_name=self.image_storage_bucket_name,
            filename=self.image_url)
</code></pre>

The above sample code illustrates how I typically use <code>url_for_s3</code>. For a given instance of a model, if that model's file is stored locally, then generate its URL using <code>flask.url_for</code>; otherwise, switch to <code>url_for_s3</code>. Only one extra parameter is needed: the S3 bucket name.

<pre class="html"><code>  LEFTCURLYBRACKET% if model.image %RIGHTCURLYBRACKET
  <p><a href="{{ model.image_url_storageaware }}">View original</a></p>
  LEFTCURLYBRACKET% endif %RIGHTCURLYBRACKET

I can then easily show the "storage-aware URL" for this model in my front-end templates.

<h2>Using flask-thumbnails-s3</h2>

In my use case, the majority of the files being uploaded are images, and most of those images need to be resized when displayed in the front-end. Also, ideally, the dimensions for resizing shouldn't have to be pre-specified (i.e. thumbnails shouldn't only be able to get generated when the original image is first uploaded); new thumbnails of any size should get generated on-demand per the templates' needs. The front-end may change according to the design / branding whims of clients and other stakeholders, further on down the road.

<a href="https://github.com/silentsokolov/flask-thumbnails">flask-thumbnails</a> handles just this workflow for local files; so, I decided to fork it and to create flask-thumbnails-s3, which works the same as flask-thumbnails when set to use local files, but which can also store and retrieve thumbnails on a S3 bucket.

<pre class="html"><code>    LEFTCURLYBRACKET% if image %RIGHTCURLYBRACKET
    <div>
    <img src="LEFTCURLYBRACKETLEFTCURLYBRACKET image|thumbnail(size,
                                 crop=crop,
                                 quality=quality,
                                 storage_type=storage_type,
                                 bucket_name=bucket_name) RIGHTCURLYBRACKETRIGHTCURLYBRACKET"
        alt="LEFTCURLYBRACKETLEFTCURLYBRACKET alt RIGHTCURLYBRACKETRIGHTCURLYBRACKET" title="LEFTCURLYBRACKETLEFTCURLYBRACKET title RIGHTCURLYBRACKETRIGHTCURLYBRACKET" />
    </div>
    LEFTCURLYBRACKET% endif %RIGHTCURLYBRACKET
</code></pre>

(From: <a href="https://github.com/Jaza/flask-s3-save-example/blob/master/templates/macros/imagethumb.html"><code>https://github.com/Jaza/flask-s3-save-example/blob/master/templates/macros/imagethumb.html</code></a>).

Like its parent project, flask-thumbnails-s3 is most commonly invoked by way of a template filter. If a thumbnail of the given original file exists, with the specified size and attributes, then it's returned straightaway; if not, then the original file is retrieved, a thumbnail is generated, and the thumbnail is saved to the specified storage back-end.

At the moment, flask-thumbnails-s3 blocks the running thread while it generates a thumbnail and saves it to S3. Ideally, this task would get sent to a queue, and a "dummy" thumbnail would be returned in the immediate request, until the "real" thumbnail is ready in a later request. The <a href="https://github.com/aidanlister/sorlery">Sorlery</a> plugin for Django uses the queued approach. It <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5562942/django-s3-boto-sorl-thumbnail-suggestions-for-optimisation">would be cool</a> if flask-thumbnails-s3 (optionally) did the same. Anyway, it works without this fanciness for now; extra contributions welcome!

(By the way, in my testing, this is much less of a problem if your Flask app is deployed on an Amazon EC2 box, particularly if it's in the same region as your S3 bucket; unsurprisingly, there appears to be much less latency between an EC2 server and S3, than there is between a non-Amazon server and S3).

<h2>Using flask-admin-s3-upload</h2>

The purpose of flask-admin-s3-upload is basically to provide the same 'save' functionality as s3-saver, but automatically within <a href="https://flask-admin.readthedocs.org/">Flask-Admin</a>. It does this by providing alternatives to the <code>flask_admin.form.upload.FileUploadField</code> and <code>flask_admin.form.upload.ImageUploadField</code> classes, namely <code>flask_admin_s3_upload.S3FileUploadField</code> and <code>flask_admin_s3_upload.S3ImageUploadField</code>.

(Anecdote: I actually wrote flask-admin-s3-upload before any of the other tools in this suite, because I began by working with a part of my project that has no custom front-end, only a Flask-Admin based management console).

Using the utilities provided by flask-admin-s3-upload is fairly simple:

<pre class="python"><code>from os import path

from flask_admin_s3_upload import S3ImageUploadField

from project import admin, app, db
from foo.models import Thingy
from library.admin_utils import ProtectedModelView
from library.prefix_file_utcnow import prefix_file_utcnow


class ThingyView(ProtectedModelView):
    column_list = ('image',)
    form_excluded_columns = ('image_storage_type',
                             'image_storage_bucket_name')

    form_overrides = dict(
        image=S3ImageUploadField)

    form_args = dict(
        image=dict(
            base_path=app.config['UPLOADS_FOLDER'],
            relative_path=app.config['THINGY_IMAGE_RELATIVE_PATH'],
            url_relative_path=app.config['UPLOADS_RELATIVE_PATH'],
            namegen=prefix_file_utcnow,
            storage_type_field='image_storage_type',
            bucket_name_field='image_storage_bucket_name',
        ))

    def scaffold_form(self):
        form_class = super(ThingyView, self).scaffold_form()
        static_root_parent = path.abspath(
            path.join(app.config['PROJECT_ROOT'], '..'))

        if app.config['USE_S3']:
            form_class.image.kwargs['storage_type'] = 's3'

        form_class.image.kwargs['bucket_name'] = \
            app.config['S3_BUCKET_NAME']
        form_class.image.kwargs['access_key_id'] = \
            app.config['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']
        form_class.image.kwargs['access_key_secret'] = \
            app.config['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
        form_class.image.kwargs['static_root_parent'] = \
            static_root_parent

        return form_class


admin.add_view(ThingyView(Thingy, db.session, name='Thingies'))
</code></pre>

Note that flask-admin-s3-upload only handles saving, not deleting (the same as the regular Flask-Admin file / image upload fields only handle saving). If you wanted to handle deleting files in the admin as well, you could (for example) use s3-saver, and hook it in to one of the Flask-Admin event callbacks.

<h2>In summary</h2>

I'd also like to mention: one thing that others have implemented in Flask, is <a href="http://philfreo.com/blog/how-to-allow-direct-file-uploads-from-javascript-to-amazon-s3-signed-by-python/">direct JavaScript-based</a> upload <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3-upload-python">to S3</a>. Implementing this sort of functionality in my tool suite would be a great next step; however, it would have to play nice with everything else I've built (particularly with flask-thumbnails-s3), and it would have to work for local- and for S3-based files, the same as all the other tools do. I don't have time to address those hurdles right now &ndash; another area where contributions are welcome.

I hope that this article serves as a comprehensive guide, of how to use the Flask S3 tools that I've recently built and contributed to the community. Any questions or concerns, please drop me a line.
