      "comment": "Well, there is always <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=localstorage\">localstorage</a> available. Amount of space varies across browsers and is user-configurable, but usually you have 5-10 MB to work with. One problem is that you have to use JavaScript to access it, so it's not readily available for server-side processing."

Above that your cookies start disappearing in request."
