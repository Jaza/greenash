If so, then yes, it does indeed incorporate everything by itself, no need for <code>S3Saver</code>. However, it only works with <code>Flask-Admin</code>, whereas <code>S3Saver</code> is a stand-alone library (doesn't even need Flask, its only dependency is Boto). Also, if you think it would be of use, then could you post a link to your example application, or provide relevant code snippets from it?"
