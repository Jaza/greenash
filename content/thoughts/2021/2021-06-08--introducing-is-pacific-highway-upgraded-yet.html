title: "Introducing: Is Pacific Highway Upgraded Yet?"

teaser: |-
  Check out this fun little site that I just built: <a href="https://ispacifichighwayupgradedyet.com/">Is Pacific Highway Upgraded Yet?</a>

  [thumbnail ispacifichighwayupgradedyet-nope.jpg Spoiler alert: no it's not!]

  I got thinking about this, in light of the government's announcement at the end of 2020 that the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-17/pacific-highway-urgrade-finally-finished/12988488">Pacific Highway upgrade is finished</a>. I was like, hang on, no it's not! How about a web site to tell people how long we've already been waiting for this (spoiler alert: ages!), and how much longer we'll probably be waiting?

  Complete with a countdown timer, which is currently set to 1 Jan 2030, a date that I arbitrarily and fairly optimistically picked as the target completion date of the <a href="https://roads-waterways.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects/raymond-terrace-upgrade/index.html">Hexham bypass</a> (but that project is still in the planning stage, no construction dates have currently been announced).

  Fellow Australians, enjoy!
