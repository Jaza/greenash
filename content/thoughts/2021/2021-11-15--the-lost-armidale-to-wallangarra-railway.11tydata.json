      "comment": "The article is full of incorrect facts. The line was not completely closed in 1988. Freight and heritage trains ran to Dumaresq up to around 2002. Tourist trains run between Warwick and Wallangarra most months not every \"blue moon\" as they claim. And there are plans to have trains return to the tracks and there is a significant number of local residents that support that option."

      "comment": "There is no overwhelming community support for the rail trail aka bike track and majority of residents want rail services reinstated north of Armidale. The current petition has nearly 9000 signatures and with both commercial and heritage rail operators interested in using the line again this will surely take priority over some bike track."
