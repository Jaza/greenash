      "comment": "The article is full of incorrect facts. The line was not completely closed in 1988. Freight and heritage trains ran to Dumaresq up to around 2002. Tourist trains run between Warwick and Wallangarra most months not every \"blue moon\" as they claim. And there are plans to have trains return to the tracks and there is a significant number of local residents that support that option."
